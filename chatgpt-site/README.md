# 오늘신상 서버 사이트

공식 식품 브랜드 발표에서 확인한 신상품을 D1에 보관하고 보여 주는 [vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext) 기반 사이트입니다. 이 폴더는 상위 `oneul-sinsang` Git 저장소의 일부이며, 상위 폴더의 GitHub Pages 미리 보기와는 별도 배포 대상입니다.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.13.0`
- Portable: Windows, macOS, or Linux; no Bash required
- Managed Linux: managed Linux runtime with Bash, `flock`, `curl`, `sha256sum`, and GNU `timeout`
- Git is required only for publishing

## Sites Lifecycle

The Sites initializer copies the shared starter and selects managed-linux only when `SITES_MANAGED_LINUX_CONTAINER=1`; otherwise it selects portable. It saves the selection only in ignored `.sites-runtime/execution-profile.json`. Both profiles copy/configure first, then use the plugin's separate `install-dependencies.mjs` step to measure installation independently. Edit source under `app/` and follow the Sites skill for installation, preview, builds, and publishing.

Run `node <plugin-root>/scripts/configure-execution-profile.mjs` only when the profile is unknown for the current checkout and environment. Profile changes do not alter tracked source or require reinstalling otherwise-valid dependencies; restart an existing preview to use the new selection. Do not commit or upload `.sites-runtime/`.

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

`install:ci` runs `npm ci` once against the shared lockfile, disables parent-workspace discovery, and includes required dev/optional dependencies despite production/omit settings. Sharp defaults to prebuilt binaries unless explicitly configured otherwise. Do not overlap installers.

- **Portable:** Preserve host HOME, npm cache, registry, proxy, temporary paths, retry/concurrency settings, and lifecycle-script policy. Use `--prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund`.
- **Managed Linux:** Use the existing project-local HOME/cache/tmp setup and Linux install lock, tarball preflight, and timeout. Restore the image-seeded npm cache only when its lockfile hash matches; retain network fallback. Builds keep their existing timeout. These helpers are not invoked by the portable profile.

`scripts/sites-env.mjs` preserves the caller's HOME, npm cache, proxy, XDG, and temporary-directory configuration while defaulting Wrangler and Miniflare state to the checkout. If npm reports an unwritable cache, select a writable path with `npm_config_cache` for that install. The `dev` and `start` scripts also keep Wrangler logs inside the checkout. Generated `.sites-runtime/` and `.wrangler/` directories are disposable and ignored by Git.

On portable, `npm run dev` uses `vinext dev` with HMR, starting at port 5173. Vinext records the running server in ignored `.vinext/` state, rejects an ordinary duplicate launch, and recovers stale state after a stopped process; exactly simultaneous starts can race. Pass `--port <port>` or `--hostname <host>` after `npm run dev --` when needed; keep portable previews on loopback.

For browser QA on managed Linux, use `sites-preview start`. The project's dev script runs Vite and accepts the supervisor's `--host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173 --strictPort` arguments. The internal browser uses `http://terminal.local:4173/`; it is not a user-facing URL. The supervisor owns the preview lifecycle. The ignored local profile survives the supervisor's cleared process environment.

The portable profile simulates ChatGPT sign-in only for loopback development requests. Visit `/signin-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign in as `local_seedy` (`seedy@sites.test`, display name `Seedy`) and `/signout-with-chatgpt?return_to=/` to sign out. The development cookie preserves that identity across server restarts. Mock auth is disabled in the managed-linux profile and is not included in production builds; hosted authentication remains dispatch-owned.

The Worker uses `vinext/server/fetch-handler`, including Vinext's config-aware image handling. After building, `npm start` runs that Worker locally through Wrangler on `127.0.0.1`, sharing `.wrangler/state` with dev preview and local D1 migrations; it does not deploy the site or simulate sign-in. Use the URL printed by the server. Pass `npm start -- --port <port>` to select a different built-preview port.

Local previews use Miniflare's placeholder `Request.cf` metadata without a network lookup. Set `CLOUDFLARE_CF_FETCH_ENABLED=true` to opt into fetching preview metadata; this setting does not change hosted request metadata.

Local tool usage metrics are disabled by default. Set `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=true` to opt in.

## Project shape

- `app/page.tsx` shows the collected products; `app/api/products/route.ts` serves a no-store public list containing only display fields
- `app/api/collect/` contains authenticated collection endpoints, including `POST /api/collect/all`
- `lib/collectors/` reads official Binggrae, Orion, Samyang Foods, Maeil, and Pulmuone announcements
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` provides optional dispatch-owned ChatGPT sign-in helpers
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares the Sites D1 binding; R2 is unused
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/index.ts` reads the D1 binding from the Cloudflare Worker environment
- `db/schema.ts` defines product records and their unique brand/name key
- `cloudflare-env.d.ts` declares the `DB` and optional `COLLECTOR_TOKEN` runtime bindings
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle/0000` through `0002` define the current product schema

## Product collection

Run `npm run collect:check` for a read-only check of official sources. It neither opens the database nor saves products, and exits unsuccessfully if a source fails or returns no candidates. Actual writes are performed only by authenticated collection endpoints. Configure `COLLECTOR_TOKEN` as a hosted runtime secret before using those endpoints; never commit it or print it in logs. Without that setting, they return HTTP 503. Publishing alone does not start collection or populate an empty database.

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Use it as the durable user key; use email and name for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive `oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty `name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by `oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```

## Optional Dispatch-Owned ChatGPT Sign-In

Import the ready-to-use helpers from `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` when the site needs optional or required ChatGPT sign-in:

- Use `getChatGPTUser()` for optional signed-in UI.
- Use the returned `userId` as the stable user key for user-owned records; do not use email as a durable identifier.
- Use `requireChatGPTUser(returnTo)` for server-rendered pages that should send anonymous visitors through Sign in with ChatGPT.
- In a Server Component, start sign-in with `<a href={chatGPTSignInPath(returnTo)} target="_top">`. The auth helper module is server-only; do not import it into a Client Component.
- Do not use `fetch`, XHR, a client-side router, or a framework link that can prefetch the sign-in route. SIWC must start as a top-level navigation.
- Never request the AuthAPI authorization endpoint directly. The dispatch-owned `/signin-with-chatgpt` route must start the SIWC flow.
- Use `chatGPTSignOutPath(returnTo)` for browser sign-out links or actions.
- Pass a same-origin relative `returnTo` path for the destination after sign-in or sign-out. The helper validates and safely encodes it.
- Mark protected pages with `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` because they depend on per-request identity headers.

Dispatch owns `/signin-with-chatgpt`, `/signout-with-chatgpt`, `/callback`, the OAuth cookies, and identity header injection. Do not implement app routes for those reserved paths. Routes that do not import and call the helper remain anonymous-compatible.

SIWC establishes identity only; it does not prove workspace membership. Use the Sites hosting platform's access policy controls for workspace-wide restrictions, or enforce explicit server-side membership or allowlist checks.

Use SIWC for account pages, user-specific dashboards, saved records, and write actions tied to the current ChatGPT user. Leave public content anonymous.

## Local D1 migrations

For a fresh D1-backed local preview, build once through the Sites skill's build entrypoint (or `npm run build` for standalone use) to generate `dist/server/wrangler.json`. From this folder, apply the pending migrations in order:

```sh
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0000_minor_jamie_braddock.sql
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0001_shocking_wolverine.sql
node --import ./scripts/sites-env.mjs ./node_modules/wrangler/bin/wrangler.js d1 execute DB --local --config dist/server/wrangler.json --persist-to .wrangler/state --file drizzle/0002_bouncy_lake.sql
```

Use `.wrangler/state`, not `.wrangler/state/v3`; Wrangler adds the versioned directories. Do not replay migrations already applied locally. These commands update only the preview database; publishing applies production migrations separately and requires explicit approval. Keep applied migration files unchanged.

## Diagnostic Commands

- `npm run install:ci`: perform the one locked dependency install
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite/Vinext development server
- `npm run build`: build the deployable Sites artifact
- `npm run start`: preview the built Worker locally with D1/R2 support
- `npm run lint`: check the server site source with ESLint
- `npm run typecheck`: check TypeScript without writing incremental state
- `npm test`: run the collector and merge behavior tests
- `npm run runtime:check`: verify the running loopback preview, products API, and public write guard (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8788`)
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes

When using the Sites plugin, follow its skill instructions for installation, builds, and publishing. These npm commands remain available for standalone use.

The portable build runs Vinext directly without a host `timeout` command. The managed-linux build uses `scripts/build-verified.sh` and its existing `SITES_BUILD_TIMEOUT` setting.
